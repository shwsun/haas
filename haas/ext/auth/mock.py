    By default, the request does not have access to a project, and does not
    have admin access. The functions `set_admin` and `set_project` can be
    used to change this.

    If invoked before `authenticate`, `set_auth_success` may be used to change
    the return value of `authenticate`, which is useful for testing cases where
    the user is not authenticated at all. Note that if the api call functions
    are invoked directly, `authenticate` is bypassed, so you will need to
    actually spoof a full request. The defualt is True.
